Flip Card provides drop-in support for CSS 3D cards that flip over. Your browser
must support CSS 3D Transforms in order for it to work properly. Useful for
bios, service listings, and other situations where you might want to rely on
user interest/interaction before showing more content.

Example

    <flip-card axis="x">
      <front>Front of card</front>
      <back>Back of card</back>
    </flip-card>

Options

An `axis` attribute can be added directly to the `<flip-card>` element. At this
time there are only two options:

* `y` axis is default. It's what you typically see. The card flips left to right.
* `x` axis means it turns upside-down while it flips.
